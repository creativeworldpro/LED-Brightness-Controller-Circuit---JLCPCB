# LED-Brightness-Controller-Circuit---JLCPCB
A common brightness-control circuit for LEDs uses an electrically controlled potentiometer (EPOT) to achieve digital control of the LED brightness. There is an alternative that reduces the number of ICs and control lines. You can control each LED driver directly with a single output port.
